# My Journal
My Journal is a safe space for users to keep track of their thoughts, feelings, experiences, and moods.  It's a journaling app where users can write about their day or get deep with their feelings.  Users will be able to sign in to their private account so they will be the only ones to read their entries.  After they write a journal entry, users can then pin different moods to the day depending on how they are feeling that day (they can create more moods as well using the Moods link in the nav bar).  They can also upload photos of the day to better remember their experiences.
